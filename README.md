# Grokking Algorithms
This repository was created to store algorithms from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava. <br>
The oficial repository is https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms - with many programming languages for you to check. <br>
Here I'll use Typescript to add type safety and improve my development experience.
Feel free to ask and suggest changes.

## How to test the scripts?

1 - Clone this repo: <mark>git clone https://github.com/ItaloCovas/grokking-algorithms.git</mark> <br>
2 - Open your terminal in the root folder and run:  <b>npm install</b> <br>
3 - Choose the file that you want to test and run:  <b>npx ts-node 'DIRECTORY'</b> <br>
EXAMPLE: <b>npx ts-node '.\1 - Binary Search\binarySearch.ts'</b>
